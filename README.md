# Groq-chat
Learning by Doing: My First AI Chatbot at Aspire Training
irst Hands-On Project During Aspire Training — AI Chatbot with Groq 🔹 What I used
Groq API for ultra-fast inference
LLaMA 3.3 (70B) as the language model
Gradio for the interactive chat UI
Hugging Face Spaces for deployment
🔹 How I built it
Designed a custom chat interface (with styled chat bubbles)
Connected the frontend to Groq’s API
Managed conversation history so the chatbot remembers context
Deployed everything on Hugging Face so anyone can access it 
🔹 Why I did this
 As a student, I believe learning is strongest when you build and break things yourself. This project helped me understand:
How real AI APIs work
How frontend and backend connect
How to deploy an AI app publicly
✨ Final Output
 A fully functional AI chatbot that responds in real time, looks clean, and runs live on the web — not just in a notebook.
This is just the beginning. More experiments coming 🚀
